Hi everybody.
These code was program by the yunduan studio of ShenYang Normal university.
We are doing an IOT project.The Esp8266 was connected with the server. 
Through an app, we can remotely control esp8266 and then control MCU by esp8266.
So thats code was a part of our project.
Hope we can do more thing for open source community.
